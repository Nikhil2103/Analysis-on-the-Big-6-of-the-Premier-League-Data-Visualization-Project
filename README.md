# An analysis on the Big6 of English Premier League Football

The English Premier league is a professional football(soccer) league established in 1992. It is one of the most watched soccer leagues in the world, that takes place in the UK. It is known for its competitiveness and exciting brand of football.
Many European nations have their own league; however, the most watched ones are in England, Spain, Italy, Germany and in recent years, even France has been added to the list. The English league is currently at the top, in terms of revenue generated and the level of support.

Among all the teams in the premier league, the most popular are the BIG SIX (Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur), who have the most fans due to their success and their roster of good players and great managers. 




## Project's Aim
Aim of this project to do exploratory data analysis on premier league data and answer the folliwing Questions

* How have the Big 6 teams fared over the years ?
* Has the league become more competitive?
* Have any midtable teams tasted success during this period?


* Finally, I used a regression model to analyze the relationship between Goal difference and the position in the league table.
I use the same model to predict the final position of the teams in the ongoing premier league(2021/22) based on their Goal differential.

* I have presented my findings on a tableau Story. The link is pasted below.
